         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE ARGVMENT, COMPREHENDING THE <hi>PREROGATIVES OF</hi> FAIRE WRITING.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough this Subject may ſeeme baſe, not being great matters, but BARE LET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS, yet it is worthie of great promotion, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it maintaineth al other Subjects, as ſhall bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>(GOD</hi> willing) heereafter, and that the right performance of the action thereof, called WRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TING, is an Arte as Honourable, Needefull, Profitable, Rare, Auncient, Noblie deſcended, and conſequentlie as Excellent as anie other, which I prooue by forcible Reaſons.</p>
            <p>It is Honourable, for two of the moſt chief, the one grounded upon the rare practiſes of the moſt bleſſed, great, and rare <hi>PATRON,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it not onelie pleaſed Him to honour it, in writing of the Tables of the Lawe with His owne Sacred Hand, (ſpoken ſo for our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:) But His Bleſſed Sonne, our onelie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb facs="tcp:6229:10"/> bowed Himſelfe in the Temple of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and wrote on the ground. The other Reaſon, taken from the practiſes of Man: for is there anie King or Monarch in the World, who applieth not himſelfe to learne this Arte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſhould neglect and forgoe all others?</p>
            <p>Needfull, for other two Reaſons: the firſt, Tending to our Eternall happineſſe: for it was inevitable and neceſſarie that the Worde of the <hi>LORD</hi> ſhould bee written, that it might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever: And though the uſe both of Writing, and of all that is written will expire at the Day of Iudgement, yet the ſame verie Worde which now is written will endure eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie; becauſe it is eternall, as both Hee is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from whome it proceedeth as the Author, and Hee who is not onlie the Subject thereof, but the verie WORD it ſelfe: Who by it will pronounce the Sentences both of Abſolution and condemnation at that Great Day: and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there ere Hee ſuffer one jot or Letter thereof to be voyde or remaine unaccompliſhed, Heaven and Earth will paſſe away. And the ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, tending to the weale of our temporall eſtate, becauſe without the uſe of Writing, and Letters written, no Eſtate in the World could ſtand: ſeeing it not onlie keepeth conſtant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of Promiſes, Rightes, and Dueties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man, from Generation to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but likewiſe goeth in Ambaſſage from
<pb facs="tcp:6229:11"/> Nation to Nation in all effaires, expreſſing mens Mindes whoſe perſons bee abſent, as if they were preſent. Indeede, without the uſe of Printing, the Eſtates of the Worlde might ſtand, like as they did more than 5400. yeares, for it is not aboue 200. yeares yet ſince it began to flowriſh: and ſo there is not ſo great neceſſitie in the uſe of Printing, as of Writing; for Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting muſt needes be, or elſe there could be litle Civile order; but each one circumvene and ſpoyle his Neighbour without remedie of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p>Profitable, for two reſpectes alſo: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe univerſallie as manie liue by the practiſe thereof, in good eſtate, as by the practiſe of anie other Arte: and next, becauſe Printing could ſcarcelie ever haue beene, if Writing had not beene firſt: for Printing was not onelie firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by the occaſion of ſweirneſſe in writing, and in-holding of maintenance to Writers; but likewiſe the firſt patterne of printing Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, was made conforme to written Letters: yea, Printing could ſcarcelie yet continue, if it were not up-holden, and maintained by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: for what Booke was ever, or can bee yet, ſo well and eaſilie printed, as that which was, and is firſt written; whereby it is certaine, that Printing is as inferiour, as it is poſterior unto Writing, and that for three cauſes: firſt, becauſe upon everie occaſion the mindes of men may
<pb facs="tcp:6229:11"/> bee farre better ſignified unto others in ſheduls, and their promiſes performed, or at leaſt, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to performe, in ſecurities, by the meane of Writing, than of Printing; ſeeing the one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in doing, preſerving, and multiplying of anie thing while it is in doing: and the other, but to preſerue and multiplie extractes of a thing alreadie done. Secondlie, becauſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is practiſed by manie, not onelie becauſe it is neceſſarie to all, but both becauſe it is eaſie of it ſelfe, and the meanes thereof eaſilie carried; whereas Printing is onelie practiſed by fewe, ſince it is neyther needfull for everie one, eaſie to practiſe, nor the meanes wherewith eaſie to tranſporte, yea, though even made in the moſte rare and compendious manner. And thirdlie, were not by occaſion of the worthie exerciſe of VVriting, (as I haue ſayde) howe could there ever haue beene anie ſuch preſervation of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by Printing? anie ſuch manifeſtation thereof, by multiplying of Bookes printed? and by conſequent, ever anie ſuch immortalitie, and univerſalitie of fame purchaſed eyther through Learning, or valiant deedes by mortall men, as now there bee, of ſome renowned, in all Ages paſt? for a mortall fame, that is, an unwritten fame, may well ſurviue him unto whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, and continue the next generation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but is rarelie found in the ſecond, except of ſome rare perſon: ſo then, if the famous reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb facs="tcp:6229:12"/> of renowned men had aye died when themſelues died, through defect of Writing, what could they haue left of all their endevours behinde them? for was not Wiſedome, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noures, Learning, Riches, and ſuch others, in the Worlde before them?</p>
            <p>Rare, becauſe by all appearance the ſecrecie and hidde knowledge of all the precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hath not beene clearelie revealed to the Youth in former Ages, yea, is ſcarcelie yet, in anie Schoole whatſoever, except where this Booke is diligentlie taught. And ſurelie I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that ſo manie Volumes haue beene written on all Subjectes, Sciences, and Artes, (except this Subject and Arte) in all Nations, in all Ages, and by all ſortes of people, ſhewing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie howe to attaine to the right knowledge and practiſe thereof; as alſo, that even ſo manie ſortes of Exemplare Bookes of fayre writ, are printed, and extant, and yet none haue ſhewed anie perfect way how to followe them without a guide, by writing the complete Arte of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelfe! It is true, ſome Writers, of ſome Nations, haue written ſome preceptes, howe to follow ſome of the moſt uſuall formes of Writ amongſt themſelues; but never anie <hi>SCOTTISH</hi> Man hath left anie preceptes behinde him, how to write anie forme, eyther uſuall in his owne Countrey, or elſe-where.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:6229:12"/>
            <p> Auncient, becauſe certaine it is, that Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath beene from the beginning, and not onlie flowriſhed long before the Deludge or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of Waters, amongſt the curious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of Sciences and Artes, as appeareth by the charitable regarde either of SETH, or ſome other, who for the benefite and weale of the poſteritie, cauſed write or graue the ſame on two pillars, the one of Tyle, to abide fire, and the other of Stone, againſt water: but likewiſe, not long after the Floode, amongſt the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, as is evident, both by the Skill of <hi>MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES,</hi> who beeing trained up in Aegypt, that read the Tables of the Law, as ſoone as he ſawe them, and of the moſte parte then of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, who beeing participant of the ſame educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that doubtleſſe could haue done the like action. And though ſufficient warrand could not bee produced, for approbation of theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, yet naturall Reaſon cannot bee prejud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor fruſtrated of its owne place: for what Librall Science or Arte can bee older than Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſince everie Librall Science and Arte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved to bee written, both for helping the memorie of the Author in inventing, and of the Studentes in learning: (howbeit <hi>Socrates</hi> in his time, was of the contrarie opinion) ſo it hath pleaſed <hi>GOD,</hi> by the meane of Writing not onelie to nouriſh and traine up, all Sciences and Artes in their infancie and minoritie, but
<pb facs="tcp:6229:13"/> principallie to defende them ſo in their full age and majoritie, againſt all aſſaultes of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who ever haue beene, and yet are, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enemies to Learning, that aye when as they deſtroyed anie worthie worke in one Booke, it was found againe in another: and hereby alſo, <hi>GOD</hi> bee prayſed, was <hi>Antiochus</hi> diſappointed of his malicious and deviliſh attempt, who commaunded to gather together all the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpts of the Sacred <hi>BIBLE,</hi> (as he ſuppoſed) and then cauſed burne them in a terrible fire.</p>
            <p>And Noblie deſcended, becauſe no Arte hath an Author more noble nor excellent, becauſe the Author thereof is infinitelie aboue all No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and Excellencie: for doubtleſſe <hi>GOD</hi> Himſelfe, who is the Author of all Goodneſſe, firſt deviſed and ordained it, as a thing good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of it ſelfe; and that eyther immediatelie as hee marked <hi>Kaine,</hi> with ſome hieroglyphicall or aenigmaticall letters, one or moe; by the Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ſignification whereof, hee was perfectlie and notoriouſlie knowne to bee a Murtherer: or mediatelie by enduing others with the rare gift of Invention, as he did manie Artificers, eyther at the building of the Arke, in the dayes of <hi>NOAH,</hi> or at the building of the Tabernacle, in the dayes of <hi>MOSES</hi> and <hi>AARON,</hi> or elſe at that incomparable building of the Temple of <hi>HIERVSALEM,</hi> in the dayes of King <hi>SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOMON.</hi> VVhereby it evidentlie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb facs="tcp:6229:13"/> that this Arte hath beene invented by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration; for doubtleſſe as the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures are concluded with this caveat, <hi>Let no man preſume eyther to adde unto them, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from them,</hi> becauſe they are ſo abſolute, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and perfect, that they containe all thinges neceſſarie unto ſalvation: ſo it lay never in anie mans power in anie Age, eyther to adde or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh a jote, to or from the number of thoſe Letters which it pleaſed <hi>GOD</hi> to ordaine, as ſo manie ſtrong Holdes, Caſtles, and Yron Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, wherein to preſerue theſe our happie Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and heavenlie Rightes, from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all Tyrants, and enemies of the Trueth whatſoever: and for as few in number as theſe Letters bee, they not onelie over-flowe all the Bookes in the Worlde, and containe the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of all Nations, (although indeede fewer of them doe containe ſome Languages, than others) but thereby anie that are nowe living, may know the minde, and diſpoſition of a man, who died a thouſand yeares agoe, &amp; ſo in ſome ſorte haue conference wirh him: which is no ſmall Miracle, were not cuſtome thereof (as of manie other thinges) breedeth contempt, and miſregarde!</p>
            <p>So if all theſe Reaſons bee rightlie weighed and conſidered, who can juſtlie denie, but the <hi>ARTE OF FAIRE WRITING</hi> ought to bee as well <hi>ESTEEMED,</hi> becauſe it is as <hi>HONOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6229:14"/> as well <hi>MAINTAINED,</hi> becauſe it is as <hi>NEEDFVLL;</hi> as well <hi>EMBRACED,</hi> becauſe it is as <hi>PROFITABLE;</hi> as great <hi>IN REQVEST,</hi> becauſe it is as <hi>RARE;</hi> as high <hi>IN PLACE,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is as <hi>AVNCIENT;</hi> and as well <hi>REGAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DED,</hi> becauſe it is as <hi>NOBLIE</hi> deſcended as anie other Arte? And thus much concerning the Renowne, Neceſſitie, Vtilitie, Raritie, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, Authoritie; or, to reduce all in one, the <hi>EXCELLENCIE</hi> of the <hi>ARTE OF FAIRE WRITING.</hi>

               <p>Secondlie, becauſe not onelie Writing is a ſpeciall meane whereby the Youth doe attaine to other Learning, in all Seminaries thereof,

               <p>Though the Definition of Writing, may agree alſo unto Printing, yet it doeth holde well enough, ſince the ſuperiour worde <hi>VVriting</hi> is generall to both: alwayes Writing may haue a more particular Definition than the former, and bee ſo proper unto it ſelfe, that it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Printing, and this is it: <hi>VVriting</hi> may not onelie bee called a preſent framing and expreſsing of one Letter after another, to ſignifie the articulate voyce of the
<pb facs="tcp:6229:19"/> Tongue, whereby the thoughtes of the minde are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to theſe who bee preſent, and to interprete the minde, (without uſe of the tongue) unto thoſe who bee abſent: but likewiſe a ſpeciall meane, whereby the memorie of thinges by paſſed is preſerved, and the fore-knowledge of thinges to come revealed.</p>
               <p>Now although <hi>Printing</hi> may ſay, <hi>Framing</hi> and <hi>Expreſſing,</hi> yet it may not ſay, <hi>Preſent framing,</hi> and <hi>expreſſing:</hi> that is, both to frame and ſet downe Letters, and therewith to expreſſe wordes and ſentences at everie inſtant, without the ayde of other Artificers: for the worde <hi>preſent</hi> is proper onelie to Writing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the action thereof is readie and eaſie, to bee proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at everie occaſion, without the helpe of ſuch ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, <hi>Printing</hi> may well ſay, <hi>Framing</hi> and <hi>Expreſſing</hi> of Letters in the plurall number, but it may not ſay, <hi>of one Letter after another</hi> adviſedlie in the ſingular: becauſe it conſisteth in ſtamping, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing, of manie Letters, (right or wrong) with one impreſsion: for they may well bee ſet in order ſeverallie, but the Impreſsion muſt bee together.

And an Arte could not juſtlie bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Arte, at the leaſt were not woorthie of the name, if each one could attaine thereunto without information and inſtruction, eyther vocall or literall.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſundrie oftentimes haue taken up ſome pretended manuell practiſe of Writing, at their owne hand, and haue knowne little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Arte: yet becauſe they could not bee able to defende their doinges, by anie other Rule of right Reaſon, than the bare worde <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> they might well ſerue their owne uſe therewith, but they could not bee meete to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others, for lacke of ſufficient qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as for exemple, Though a young Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoph,
<pb facs="tcp:6229:21"/> readie to bee laureated, were never ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if hee cannot in ſome meaſure defende and warrand his owne Theſes, by Metaphyſicall, Logicall, or Philoſophicall Argumentes and Syllogiſmes, hee is thought the more unfit to receiue the Laurell: even ſo though anie Maſter of the Arte of Writing could doe never ſo well with his Hand, if hee cannot defende the ſame with his Tongue alſo by Rules of Arte, he may well bee meete to write concerning common effaires, but to inſtruct others hee cannot; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt parte of all inſtructions doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt both as well and as much in Information as Demonſtration, that is, in ſpeaking as in doing: and it may be ſeene afterwardes in this Booke, that there requireth manie other wordes to bee ſpoken, than the former word <hi>Custome;</hi> and though it ſhould bee reapeated a thouſande times, it ſtill remaineth but one and the ſame; who then can learne or profite thereby? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ſome other Cuſtomes availe much, but this nothing.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſuch inſtructors are not unlike unto thoſe who ſpeake Latine, or ſing Muſicke onlie by the Eare, (that is, by oft hearing) and cannot defende either of them to bee right, though ſo they be; whereas the other, may bee compared to ſuch as both doe theſe things, and can defende them indeede, by indoubted know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, proven by relevant reaſons.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6229:21"/>
               <p> Likewiſe, they may bee compared unto a ſort of Friendes (if any wayes ſo I may tearme them) which we call faire faſioned friendes, who in their complementes will promiſe to doe all thinges which in them lie, that may eyther profite or pleaſure thoſe unto whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe friendſhip; but when they are prooved or charged with ſome one thing, they flatlie refuſe, and ſo transforme an affirmatiue into a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, a generall faire ſomething, into a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faire nothing: even ſo if thou wilt nowe (I meane, at the firſt publication of this Booke) enter in conference with ſome who profeſſe themſelues to be the moſt expert and faire Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Kingdome, (yea, in the World, they will readilie alledge, if they bee not contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) they will diſcourſe ſo eloquentlie and Rhetorician-like, that thou wouldeſt belieue at the firſt, they could doe wonders, let bee to knowe or doe anie thing whatſoever belonging to the Arte which they profeſſe, and take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to teach: but if thou wilt take any Line of their owne writ, and aske wherefore ſuch a Letter is faſhioned, meaſured, conjoyned, &amp;c, that way rather as another way (which if thou canſt, thou may prooue to be better) they will not only ceaſe from their diſcourſe, but become ſo ſtupefact and dumme, that they cannot ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Rule of right reaſon, nor anſwere a word to that Queſtion; and if anie dumme tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb facs="tcp:6229:22"/> can bee profitable in a Common Wealth, it is ſome good Booke rather than a man.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ſuch who haue onlie a common jade-trot of practiſe with the hand, and know no Theoricke in the minde, to utter with the tongue, may bee likened unto ſuch ſervantes as ſtand uncovered, holding or bearing a Pennar, Inkehorne, and Candle, while their Maſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyte and write concerning anie needefull pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and that becauſe there is no good ſtuffe nor giftes in them for that or the like uſe, (but ſufficiencie for ſlaviſh ſervice) in compariſon of the other ſort, but as it were ſo manie dried Bladders, having a fayre ſhewe without, and full of nothing within but winde; which, when they doe cracke, burſt foorth all at once, and leaue nothing till afterwardes: indeede I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge mine errour heere, for this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon will not alwayes holde, becauſe it is more pertinent ſometimes to compare them unto Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers Bottels, which are ſo filled with ſtrong Drinke, that they froathe over, and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that fuming rage which is within them.</p>
               <p>Well then, it is harde to knowe, whether ſuch Artiſtes, (if ſo they may bee called) who can ſcarcelie define, let bee to defende, the Arte whereby they liue: bee more ignorant, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, or they more blinde, and negligent, (in that point) who employ them, in trayning up of their Youth: for how can anie Inſtructor
<pb facs="tcp:6229:22"/> or Pedagogue, leade Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rightly in the way to Perfection, eyther of Learning or Manners, who never walked thorowe the boundes of right Direction and Diſcipline himſelfe? But as for the other ſorte, who are endued with theſe Giftes, which they want, and yet deride, can caſt up infallible Rules, guarded with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Reaſons, both of their Practiſes, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, even as ſoone as a fine Grammarian can defende anie Latine phraſe, by declaring and demonſtrating the right Grammar Rule or authoritie of anie thing, which ſhall happen to bee impugned therein, and will likewiſe haue ſome regarde of Modeſtie, Temperancie, and good behaviour. And howſoever Writing may bee done, without Rules of right Reaſon, yet fayre and perfect Writing, muſt bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by theſe Rules: and ſince therefore, it hath all the properties due unto an Arte, who can denie it to bee juſtlie intituled by the name of an Arte? yea, of a Science, (if I had chooſed) rather than Printing.</p>

               <p>THe cauſes of Writing (as of other things) be foure, the Efficient, Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, Formall, and Finall; but more Metaphoricke than proper.</p>
               <p>The Efficient cauſes are two-folde, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and inſtrumentall, or Immediate and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate; the Principall Efficient is the Writer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he (under <hi>GOD)</hi> is the ſpeciall agent or uſer of the meanes, as well in applying each one to its owne uſe, as by concurring and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating with them in doing of the action.</p>
               <p>The Inſtrumentall Efficients are likewiſe two fold, living and deade, the living Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, bee Members of the Writer his Bodie, as the Hand, Thombe, and Fingers; and the dead, (or rather; not living, becauſe it may be alleadged, that anie thing which never lived can be ſaid to be dead) is the pen onlie. And whereas I omit and exeeme the Arme, which hath the Hand and Fingers depending thereon
<pb facs="tcp:6229:26"/> &amp;c, and Pen-Knife, which is the Inſtrumentall Efficient of the Pen  I doe neither of them wrong: ſeeing it is but the neareſt cauſes which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>auſes of Writing farther than neede requireth. And while as the Hand, Thombe, and Fingers, are not alwayes the Inſtrumentall Efficients, ſeeing ſome will Write with their Feete and Toes, yea with their Teeth alſo; It is not anie ſuch accidentall and extraordinarie practiſes that I promiſed to ſpeake of, becauſe they are both tedious and needleſſe, for if thoſe perſons were not maimed, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> elſe too curious, they would not exerce them: and whatſoever other Members they employ thereanent, doe but ſupplie the place of the former, which bee the proper Inſtrumentall Efficients of the action.</p>
               <p>The Materiall cauſe of Writing, or of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written materiallie, (that is, without ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification) is the Inke, for as the paper is the ſubject whereon, ſo the Inke is the matter whereof: and ſo whether it bee a common and cheape Liquor (of whatſoever colour) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating the true lineaments and pathes of the pen, as it proceedeth foorth thereof in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Letters; or a rare and ſumptuous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, as liquid Golde or Silver, all doe conſiſt
<pb facs="tcp:6229:27"/> alike of matter or ſubſtance, though otherwayes they bee not equivalent, but diſcrepant in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; for all become drie alike ſoone, and none of them remaineth liquid more than another: but indeede if thou wilt looke to the inheſion or penetration of Letters in the ſubject, the ſame is rather accidentall than ſubſtantiall.</p>
               <p>The formall cauſe of Writing, is the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſhape of the Letter, whether it be perfectly or imperfectly proportioned; for albeit by the decent proportion of everie Letter appeareth the beautie of all the writ, yet ſometimes by the cuſtome of right reading, the Senſe of Words may be underſtood, though the Letters be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectlie written: but wee ſhould no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume heereby to doe anie thing in a wrong manner that it may be right, than to doe evill that good may proceede thereof.</p>
               <p>And the finall cauſe of Writing, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſignifying of articulate voyce, whereby the thoughts of the minde are interpreted, and the demonſtrating of the minde without the voyce; for as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth, Writs or Letters are the Symboles of Voyces or Wordes, (howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may bee thought that the Voyce beeing inviſible cannot bee repreſented by anie exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Signe) the Voyces Symboles of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<pb facs="tcp:6229:27"/> of the Minde, and the Conceptions of the Minde, Images of thinges which bee outwith the Minde: and that both of Divine Writs and Humane.</p>
               <p>Of Divine VVrits, it pleaſed the <hi>AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTIE,</hi> by the meane and ambaſſage of VVriting, to manifeſt His bleſſed VVill to the VVorlde in all Ages, (but chiefelie, and in greateſt meaſure, nowe in theſe laſt Ages) concerning His owne Glorie, and Mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which if thou wouldeſt knowe, (as thou oughteſt indeede, becauſe they are the two chiefe endes, wherefore it pleaſed Him to giue thee breath, and bring thee unto this VVorlde: for all other thine Errandes, are but as ſo manie parentizes, which will bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſoone cloſed, after thou thy ſelfe art cloſed in the Graue, whereas theſe will accompanie, thee, and goe with thee to the Heavens,) thou muſt, with aſſiſtance of his Holie Spirite, ſearch the Holie Scriptures, and there the VVrits, or Letters, will bee as Signes, leading thee to the gracious VVordes which did proceede foorth of His Sacred Mouth there anent, (to ſpeake ſo) and the wordes will leade thee to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and notions, which were in His Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Minde, and the conceptions, as Symboles, will viuelie repreſent unto thy minde, thoſe <pb facs="tcp:6229:28"/> thinges which thou kneweſt not of before.</p>
               <p>And of Humane VVrits, that is, betwixt man and man, when one is aſtricted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme anie point of duetie unto another, by VVrit, (becauſe wordes are no ſooner uttered, but they evaniſh in the Aire, except eyther VVitneſſes bee preſent, or the partie all the more truſtie) the VVrits will ſignifie the words which hee ſpake, the wordes will interprete the conceptions of his minde, (except diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which nowe aboundeth, hath made diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepance) and the conceptions of his minde, wordes of his mouth, and ſubſcription of his hand, will tie, and obliſh him to performe thoſe thinges which hee promiſed, and under-tooke to accompliſh; and that eyther in whole or in parte, according to his power: otherwiſe, if there were no Writing nowe, I ſuſpect there woulde bee little good order in anie common wealth, or credite keeped, eyther amongſt ſtrangers, or neighbours, yea, ſcarcelie amongſt friendes; in reſpect of the infidelitie, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie, which daylie increaſeth ſo much the greater, by howe much the conſummation of this great and univerſall Fabricke approacheth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6229:56"/> therefore is nowe uſed through out the moſte part of EVROPE, but chiefelie in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Dominions. Secondlie, for the Naturall Affection I owe to His Highneſſe, all His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectes, (whereof I am one) and to all His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Realmes, but chiefelie SCOTLAND, my natiue Countrey. And thirdlie, for ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cauſe: for doubtleſſe if the whole ſortes of Characters, which bee comprehended under the generall Name, WRITING, and whereof this SECRETARIE is one, were as largelie taught, by Rules of Arte, as it is, and all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular differences thereof declared, I ſuſpect that Worke would bee ſo tedious, and the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume thereof ſo great, that the ſpace of a Mans Dayes would bee over little to write it, and not too much to reade it.</p>
               <p>Therfore I haue made choyſe to giue ſpeciall Rules for one ſort of Character, and generall Rules for all the reſt: howbeit manie of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Rules will agree alſo unto ſundrie of the moſt uſuall Characters: (although not to them all, nor yet ſtrictlie to everie part of thoſe, unto which they agree) and ſo, both Generall and Speciall, in effect, ſerving as Rules, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſortes of Writ comprehended under the Name, SECRETARIE, as Examples: becauſe in anie Grammar all the Language is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for then it would ſpender the whole dayes of the Aged, let bee of the Youth, to paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6229:56"/> but compendiouſlie directed unto by Preceptes, and briefelie demonſtrated by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: yea, often times one thing expreſſed, repreſenting an 100. thinges underſtood. And as Grammars were made of certaine Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, partlie heard by the Eare, and partlie col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected foorth of Auncient Authors of before: ſo is this Grammar made to aggree with the moſt eaſie and common Practique, obſerved by all ſkilfull and fayre Writers, which haue beene, and nowe are (as it pleaſeth God.) And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Practiſe of fayre Writing doeth preceede the Preceptes thereof, ſo manie Latine Authors are anteriour to the Latine Grammar. And it is certaine, there hath beene as perfect Latine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a Grammar, as there was fayre Writing before this Booke, which is the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar thereof. And if the Latine Grammar bee the Key of all Learning, this Grammar is the Key of that Grammar: becauſe it can hardly bee learned without the uſe of Writing: Ergo, the Grammar of fayre Writing is the Key of all Learning: For, to haue a Key locked up, and want the Key of the Place where it lieth, is (as it were) to haue a fine Bow, but it is in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. And inſomuch as ſome doe alleadge, that the Latine Grammar may bee learned without the uſe of Writing, or the Grammar thereof: the Anſwere is, So may Learning bee as well had without the uſe of the Latine Grammar: I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6229:57"/> meane, by exerciſing the Works of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for obtaining of the language, till they aſpire thereby unto farther learning: but none of them ſo ſoone, nor yet ſo well, as by theſe ordinarie meanes. And albeit I had given the Title [GRAMMAR] unto this Booke, it had not bene amiſſe; becauſe it would not haue bene repugnant to the nature thereof: for the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worde, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſignifiing <hi>Litera,</hi> beeing generallie applyed, may be aſwell, yea, (I may ſay) better, attributed unto letters, than unto languages. And as touching the common uſe of a Grammar, ſuch as Declining, Comparing, Conjugating, Forming, and Conſtructing of Words; here the like of all theſe things is done of letters; howbeit in another forme, which is proper unto it ſelfe: for, as a diclinable Worde is declined through diverſe Caſes, from the ſtraight Nominatiue; ſo is a variable Letter bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and chainged from the right Proportion thereof, through divers occaſions of practiſe, &amp; otherwiſe framed in one written Word, than in another; as likewiſe it is compared or made equall, with another of the owne kinde, conjugated or conjoyned, formed or faſhioned, and conſtructed or ſet, at diverſe occaſions, in diverſe written Words, as the proprieties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doe require. But yet ſince the Title [GRAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAR] is alreadie choſen, and become common to diverſe languages, I will not inſiſt to compare
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6229:57"/> with them, nor ſtriue for it: both becauſe I haue other as good Titles at command; and they are more to bee pitied nor envyed, which haue but one Title amongſt them all: and what regarde, if it were not borrowed too?</p>
               <p>And albeit ſtrictlie, (that is, in everie jot) the Rules and Exemples of this Booke, doe not agree to all the moſt uſuall ſortes of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, but to the moſt part; yet largely th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is true, I can hinder none to preferre any Character they pleaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but ſo farre as I can perceiue, the extent of the Rules thereof reacheth as farre, as the boundes of anie other: and therefore, they may both eaſier bee conferred therewith, to knowe the difference, and applied thereunto, to learne the Skill and practiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I acknowledge, it is now time that wee come to the particular forme how to write: but firſt thou muſt know what to write, and I muſt propone unto thee ſome things to be conſidered, for thy better enterpriſing of the action: for if thou runneſt raſhlie thereunto, without ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thou muſt conſider, that all uſuall writing doeth conſiſt in the right compoſing of the afore ſaide Symboles, or Signes of the Voyce, which bee Letters, Syllables, Wordes, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, or Lines; becauſe in expreſſing of them, all kinde of Articulate Voyce, may bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode; and conſequentlie, all Thoughtes of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nde uttered: for Syllables doe conſiſt of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Wordes of Syllables, and Sentences, or Lines, of VVordes.</p>
               <p>They are juſtlie called Symboles, or Signes of the Voyce, as well for the ſound which they ſignifie, beeing written, and is expreſſed, while as their Names are uttered, being read; as either for the matter of their compoſition, or manner of their proportion: as I ſhall doe good will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie to make plaine in particular.</p>
               <p>In a Letter are foure thinges to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: to wit, the Forme, the Knowledge, the Name, and the Sound: each one of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of another, being ranked according to their Age, or time of being, (to allude ſo) which Age doeth proceede from the Forme: becauſe a Letter can haue no age, till firſt it bee formed: and ſo the age beginneth immediatelie after the forming thereof. In like manner, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge commeth from the Forme, (I meane only by his knowledge who readeth) the Name
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6229:58"/> from the Knowledge, and the Sound from the Name: and therefore, all theſe are internall, or rather ſignificatiue, except the Forme, which is onelie externall, or demonſtratiue: becauſe it pointeth foorth, or ſignifieth, all the reſt. But if thou ranke them conforme to their value, thou muſt turne them up-ſide-downe, making the Sound of a Letter to haue the firſt place, the Name the ſecond, the Knowledge the third, (I meane onelie the knowledge of a Letter) and the Forme the fourth. For if the ſound of a word uttered could alwayes continue, and not weare out, nor evaniſh in the Aire, aſſoon as it is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there would bee little or no uſe for Writing: And therefore a Letter (I meane ſimplie a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is called a Letter, (that is, a Blotte) rather becauſe it is a Signe which repreſenteth ſome ſmall part of the Voyce, being written, (for it becommeth the ſame much it ſelfe when it is read) than eyther for the externall forme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or matter whereof it is formed: becauſe the ſound which doeth proceede from the name, is the ſuperiour qualitie, or uſe of the Letter: but the forme or frame of the Letter, whereby the name is knowne, is but a Signe, or Figure, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting that ſound. And although the ſound bee Symbolicke, yet it is to bee underſtood, as if it were reall, (to ſpeake ſo.) And as no muſicall or ſounding Inſtrument can giue perfect ſound, till the hand or mouth ſtirre up the ſame: ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6229:59"/> theſe Signes or Symboles cannot ſound of their owne accorde, but remaine and ly dead (as it were) til the voyce of the tongue reviue them, ſounde them, waken them up. A written ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, is rather called a ſillable; becauſe it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a great part of the voyce, (I meane, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it conſiſteth of diverſe letters) than for anie reſpect eyther to the matter or forme of the letters themſelues whereof it is compoſed. A written Worde, is rather called a Worde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it repreſenteth a greater part of the voyce, which beeing uttered, beateth the Aire; than for anie regard eyther to the matter or forme of the ſyllables, or letters, which bee included therein. And a written ſentence, is named a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, rather becauſe it ſignifieth the greateſt or longeſt ſound, or part of the voyce, (that is, the perfect meaning, and value of the wordes, one, or moe, which it doeth comprehende) than for the matter, or compoſition of the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as they bee written. And whereas in the ſingular number, a ſimple letter, (that is, not an Hieroglyphik letter, ſignifying a ſyllable, word, or ſentence) bee a darke and unperfect ſymbole of the voyce; becauſe it ſignifieth the leaſt part thereof: yet letters in the plurall number, are bright, and perfect enough: becauſe thereof doe conſiſt all the other three: the firſt whereof is viue, the ſecond viver, and the thirde moſte viue of all. And ſo the Cogitations of the Mind,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6229:59"/> Speaches of the Tongue, and Writing with the Hand; or rather the perſon gifted with theſe three, may bee compared unto a Clocke, which ſtriketh Houres, or meaſureth Time: For the ſecret turninges, motions, and paſſages thereof, (and chiefelie the reſtleſſe Watch,) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the Cogitations: the Bell that uttereth the particulars of time, (or becommeth Attour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in diſcharging the will of the Clocke) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the ſpeaches: and the Dyall that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth both what is meant &amp; ſpoken, ſignifieth writing. And whereas ſpeaking and writing doe often times proue contrarywiſe, it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of inconſtancie, and diſſimulation; even as falſe ſtriking, and demonſtrating of wrong houres, doe proceede of an ill tempered Clock.</p>
               <p>And albeit Reading bee often times uſed without uttering of the Voyce, and therefore may bee thought to enervate, and cut away, the Pipes of the Sound, ſignified by theſe Symbols, or, at the leaſt, attributed unto them: yet it is other wayes: for ſuch kinde of Reading procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth rather of ſome contracted habite, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the ſound of Letters, learned of before through oft reading; than of the ſpeculation, or inſpection, of their Forme, which then is ſeene. Otherwiſe, wee could no more reade without uttering of the written wordes which wee ſee, than expreſſe them without a viue ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; I meane ſuch as wee haue not recent in our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6229:60"/> memorie. And ſo albeit the right faſhioning of Letters belongeth to this Arte, yet the meaning and ſounding thereof pertaineth to reading, (except onelie in verball inſtructing of the Youth to write, they muſt needes both bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſounded, as well as faſhioned and knowne) but indeede the knowledge belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth equallie to both: for as the Skilfull Writer knoweth, at the leaſt imagineth, the right fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of Letters in his minde, before his hand write them: even ſo the perfect Reader, when eyther hee ſeeth, or findeth them written, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie knoweth their Names, by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion: and while as hee readeth, eyther by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, or ſuppreſſing of the wordes, the one muſt be by ſounding of their Names, (although not fullie, or at length, of everie name particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie) and the other, by uſuall remembrance of that ſound: which is ingraffed in memorie, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the often ſeeing of their frame, that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ſame.</p>
               <p>And, if it ſhall happen to bee demanded, wherfore I medle with anie thing here in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which belongeth unto Reading: it may bee anſwered, Even becauſe Writing and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are not onelie Brethren, (to allude ſo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all diverſitie of Gener) but unſeparable Companions: in nature, though not in uſe: and the younger of theſe dependeth on the elder: and it is certaine, that anie thing which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6229:60"/> of neceſſitie muſt fall, if it want the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereunto it leaneth. For as Writing is the Subject of Reading, ſo it is the Object alſo to the perſon that readeth. Againe, doeth not Naturall Reaſon proue, that Writing is older than Reading, how little ſoever it bee? For no Writ can be read, before it be written: (I meane not by the internall conſideration thereof, but by the externall action) and it were needleſſe, to write anie thing, but that which may bee read, by ſome, eyther in private, or publicke. Moreover, right Writing ſurmatcheth perfect Reading, as farre as Doing ſurmatcheth Saying: (I meane in Civile attemptes, and equalitie of goodneſſe) for it is farre eaſier to ſpeake a VVord, than to doe an Action: or to expone what a thing meaneth, beeing latelie paſt, than to propone the overture thereof before it was imagined. And ſo, though they bee not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in nature, yet there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them in excellencie. For if it bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that the VVorde of GOD may bee read, and furniſh comfort unto the reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; it may bee anſwered, that it could not bee read, were not (prayſed bee GOD) it is ſo graciouſlie writte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>It reſteth onelie in this place, that I ſhould define the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore-named Symboles of the Voyce, before I proceede: but I thinke it more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, as each one is ſet downe ſeverallie in its
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6229:61"/> owne place. It is true, they are defined alreadie in the Latine Grammar: yet becauſe I am (with Gods grace) to inſiſt in them particularlie, I cannot, without reprehenſion, ſpeake largelie of anie thing, except firſt I declare what it is: for perhaps manie will peruſe this Booke, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learned Latine, nor knewe the uſe of the Grammar thereof: and ſo becauſe it were a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh illuſion, to ſende ſuch to ſeeke an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne errand in an unknowne part, (I meane unto them) the definitions of the former ſignes cannot bee pretermitted, nor paſſed by. And therefore, I begin, and proceede, hencefoorth, as they giue occaſion of matter: but it behoveth mee to ſpeake moſt largelie of Letters, beeing the chiefeſt ſort; becauſe all the other three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende thereon: and then ſo much of the reſt as maketh for mee, in the illuſtration and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the deepneſſe and ſecrecie of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And whereas the Section of Letters, is not onelie farre greater than all the other three, but almoſt filleth up as much of this Volume, as all the remnant Contentes therein; it is not done without cauſe: for this whole Arte conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of Letters, becauſe the Subject it ſelfe is Letters: and what is written beſide Letters, proceedeth of Letters: at leaſt, by occaſion thereof, even as the three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And though at that time, they conciliate friendſhip, and bee ſociall with thee; yet it is incident often times, (as there is little ſoliditie here, in things beneath) that a friende to night, will become an enemie to morrowe, and ſo publiſh of thee what hee knoweth: and ſuppoſe conſtancie doe even continue, thou wilt ſtand in awe both to ſay and doe before him as thou wouldeſt; becauſe a great part of thy ſecrecie lyeth on the tongue of thy Secretarie: and perhaps ſleepeth as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundly there, as on the Top-Maſt of a Ship, in a ſtormie night. Therefore, if thou be ſuch a one, whether the negligence hath beene in thy Parents, Friends, or in thy ſelfe, ſtriue thou yet to amende the ſame, if thine age bee within 40. yeares, whether thou canſt reade or not; becauſe the dint thereof now ſtriketh on thee: for, ſome aboue that age, haue learned to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6229:63"/> write, that never of before knewe a Letter, (no, not of Print, let bee of Writ,) but ſuch as they had latelie learned of their owne Domeſtickes, as it is both better, and more commendable, to learne late, nor never; and of Inferiours, rather than want the benefite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of altogether: but immediatelie after they haue learned ſomewhat to reade, they haue begun al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to write, and then in ſhort time haue known how to reade other Mens writ, by the like Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their owne writ, and ſo haue proceeded, from one Degree to another, till they both could write and reade, Comptes and Meſſiues ſufficientlie: for oftentimes one that wanteth all, neglecteth all; and thoſe who haue ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a thing, ſeeke to a farther growth thereof: there would bee no Harveſt, if there were no Seede-time: and if a Merchand would never uſe Merchandize hencefoorth untill hee got a great Summe, wherof to make his Stocke, there would bee ſcarcelie one then, for tenne now. So, how ignorant ſoever thou bee, if thou canſt apprehende thine owne wantes, and haue anie diſpoſition to learne, the reading of this Booke will (with the helpe of God) furniſh thee Skill to write, and diligence will ſoone bring foorth habite thereof: for if it pleaſe God to bleſſe but one graine of Seede, it will increaſe an hundreth folde: then deſpiſe never a meane beginning, if it bee good, ſuppoſe it bee hard.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:6229:63"/>
                  <p> But whether thou make choyſe of the great Alphabet, which comprehendeth the ſmall; or the ſmall alone: preſume never to learne anie Capitall Letters, till thou (in ſome meaſure) be perfect of the Single and Double; both by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them ſeverallie in Alphabet, and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in writ: and that not onelie becauſe they are eaſier to learne; but becauſe all writ ſtandeth more by them, than by the Capitals, and ſo the more needfull to bee had: for in anie matter, eyther written or Printed, thou wilſt finde aye ten Single and Double Letters, (at the leaſt) for one Capitall.</p>
                  <p>Heere may ariſe a Queſtion: Howe can the Capitals bee learned by the enſuing Alphabet, ſeeing it containeth none but the ſortes of <hi>A?</hi> To the which I anſwere, They may bee learned thereby for two cauſes: firſt, who will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, but any judicious perſon (though he ſhold never travell out of his Natiue Countrey) may ſufficienthe underſtand the Situation and forms of all the Empires, and Kingdomes of the Worlde, by diligent conſideration, and often peruſing, of the Vniverſall Carde? and yet it containeth not ſo much as one of the leaſt, but is contained it ſelfe, in little rowme. Then, why may not they farre better conſider one thing ſuppreſſed, by another which is expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, it is not mine intention eyther to ſet downe Patternes of diverſe ſortes of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6229:64"/> heere, (how beit I haue manie prepared) nor yet all the Capitals of this ſame Character, but rather holde mee by the Arte it ſelfe, and that for foure reſpectes:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe there bee ſo manie Printed Bookes, both alreadie extant, and daylie ſetting foorth, which doe containe all ſortes of Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, Capitals, and fayre Writ; that it were litle more needfull, than to carrie water to the Sea, if Expences ſhould be beſtowed on the Founding &amp; Ingraving of Yrons for them, or anie others, but ſuch as cannot bee wanted, nor omitted: for the drift of this Diſcourſe requireth onelie the exhibition and demonſtration of ſome, for the better conſideration and practiſing of all. And therefore, and for the reaſons immediatelie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, I ſpeake in the Variations and Degreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Letters, and other places of this Booke heereafter, as plainlie of all Capitals under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, by the 4. onelie which bee expreſt; as if they were all expreſſed together in one Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, becauſe this Booke ſerveth as a Grammar to all writing; and conſequentlie, to the right following of all the ſortes of Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plares which bee comprehended in ſuch as the aforeſaide Bookes: and ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of another nature than they bee: for it containeth no moe ſortes of Letters, nor Exemplares than may ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie explaine and prooue the Rules thereof: even
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6229:64"/> as DISPVTERS Grammar, being a perfect Abridgement of the whole Latine Language, (ſince thereby, as one of the beſt, all Poeſies, and other Workes in Latine, bee both concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and followed) demonſtrateth no moe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emples nor authorities, than may explicate and interprete the Rules thereof: for if Grammars did comprehende all the matter of thinges at length, wherof they briefelie treate, they would ceaſe to be Grammars, (I meane concerning the uſe of them) and that for too great prolixitie, in ſtead of compendioſitie: becauſe then each one of them would bee of ſo hudge a Volume, that the underſtanding of the whole Language, and Treatiſes of the Bookes whereat they aime, would bee aſſoone apprehended, by the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of Students, as the Grammar it ſelfe; and ſo then both alike tedious to learne and conſider.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, becauſe anie who intende not to inſtruct others, haue ſtore of Exemples in this ſelfe ſame Booke, containing alſo diverſe Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; which Exemples may ſerve for Exemplares both of Capitals and Writ: and therefore, if they rightlie peruſe theſe Exemples, and the Abridgement of this Arte following hereafter, they will neede no Exemplare-Booke at all. But as for thoſe who deſire to bee better groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they muſt proceede more formally in uſing of the meanes: that is, firſt, ſtriue to underſtand the former part of this Booke, before they come
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6229:65"/> to theſe Exemples: next, endevour to conceiue them, and the Rules whereof they ariſe, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie, when they come thereunto: and in the third rowme, employ ſome faire writer to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract all the Exemples of this Booke on a ſheete of cleane paper, and make one Exemplar of them al, to reſemble: for it has theſe rules which other Copies want. And though it be not all of one Matter, becauſe the ſentences thereof are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; yet it is ſo much the better, for reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Letters whereof it is compoſed; becauſe it is ſo much the worſe both to bee got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and kept in memorie: for while as a ſtudent learneth to write, it is the Letter, and not the Matter, to follow; but having or being learned, it is the Matter, and not ſo much the Letter, whereunto hee muſt haue regarde.</p>
                  <p>And fourthlie, for ſhortneſſe, and avoyding of prolixitie: for if all the Capitals, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the Secretarie, were inſert heere in ſuch manner as I firſt intended, it would make the Alphabet ſo great, and ſeeme ſo difficult, that it would affray (at the leaſt hinder) manie, at the firſt ſight, from eſſeying thereof, who had not ſome reaſonable beginning before. Hee is not a wiſe Inſtructor, or eyther hath little to inſtruct, or deſireth fewe to profite by that which he hath, who ſhoweth foorth the whole ſecrecie, and curioſitie of his Skill, unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at the firſt, (thinking then to teach
<pb facs="tcp:6229:65"/> them the ſame) but by little and little, as they are in anie meaſure perfect in one thing, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate and adde thereunto another: and ſo foorth, daylie (as it were to beguile them) by drawing and leading them aye farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on) till they eyther learne all, or the moſte neceſſarie Documents and Experiments which hee hath to teach. It is true, Capitall Letters are more difficill to imitate, than the Single and Double: but having firſt learned the Single and Double, the Capitals then become eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. It would bee verie hard to cauſe a Rudimenter make a Right Theame, or Latine Verſe: but having learned the Rudimentes, and proceeded orderlie thorowe all the Grammar, Theame, (yea, Verſe, if hee haue the Poeticall Veine) will become as eaſie then to make, as <hi>Litera</hi> was of before to decline. So there bee manie thinges which ſeeme unto Gazers ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie admirable, and wonderfull, thorow appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of curioſitie, beeing completed; which if they had ſeen eyther in the beginning, or in the midſt of the doing, or before the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing; they would haue beene ſo farre from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the ſame, that they could haue holpen, and beene partakers of the action therof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And though there cannot (nor nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not) bee ſuch Rules preſcribed for Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Letters, as for Single and Double; yet there be ſufficiencie of Rules heere concerning them:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6229:66"/> and what is pretermitted in the one, is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the other: and that not by direction of Precept, but by due conſideration, and diligent attention, of the peruſer. Thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Preambles, and introduction to Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the abſence or retaining of Capitals foorth of thy ſight, ſo long as thou art weake, untill a more convenient time, that thou bee readier for them, as for ſtronger Foode.</p>

                  <p>THis Character doeth comprehende two chiefe ſortes of Secretarie-hand-writ, <hi>Set</hi> and <hi>Common:</hi> Set writ is written two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes, which differ more in quantitie &amp; uſe, than in qualitie and ſubſtance: firſt, it is written with a great penne, in great prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rtion at the Head clauſes, or Sentences, commonlie uſed in the beginninges, middles, or endinges of Bookes and Evidences: and with a ſmall

                  <p>Likewiſe, it is of two ſortes; the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a more principall forme of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than the ſecond: becauſe the one by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie is the Roote, and the other by deſcent the Branch: for the chiefer forme muſt needes bee aye fayrer and better written than the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarie, and ſo is more legeable: which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore challengeth the firſt place throughout all the Alphabet: that is to ſay, the firſt choyſe both of all ſortes and names of Letters therein, whether expreſſed or ſuppreſſed, belongeth unto it, and to none other. But as it is a degree better than the other, in reſpect of the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteneſſe, and exactneſſe thereof, being done; ſo it is a degree worſe than the other, in reſpect of a degree of longer time, which it conſumeth by ſlowneſſe in doing: yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Sat ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò, ſi ſat benè,</hi> a thing well done, may verie well bee eſteemed as ſoone done, excluding anie compt of <hi>Time,</hi> unleſſe it bee all the more pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſorte then, is a leſſe principall forme of its owne nature than the firſt, but not ſo ſlow; eyther whereof hath a relevant reaſon for probation: leſſe principall, (I ſay) for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it haue the firſt choyſe of all the Letters
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6229:68"/> to the great written wordes at the beginnings, or within the bodie of it; yet it hath not the firſt choyſe of all the Letters to the ſmall writ thereof, but of ſome: ſeeing the firſt choyſe of Capitals both expreſſed and underſtoode, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Letters,</hi> and all others, except two, to wit, the firſt <hi>l</hi> and <hi>t</hi> of the Alphabet, are proper onelie, and therefore reſerved to the preceeding forme: and heerein ſtandeth the difference. Not ſo ſlowe, (I ſayde) becauſe the ſeconde choyſe of Capitals, expreſſed and underſtoode, <hi>Minum Letters,</hi> and ſuch others, that the former ſort refuſeth, are not ſo ſlow, and may therefore bee written in ſhorter ſpace than the firſt choiſe of theſe Letters: and ſince ſo they bee, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not this forme, which conſiſteth of them, to bee ſo ſlow as the other: for all writ is mightilie made up of <hi>Minum Letters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, it is no indignitie unto this ſorte of writ, to ſuffer theſe Letters remaine with the former, and that for three reſpectes: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the right owner of them, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon afore mentioned. Secondlie, becauſe this forme vindicateth and obtaineth the uſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the remnant Letters unto it ſelfe, whereof the former ſort is compoſed; and ſo theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are conſtrained to yeelde ſubjection unto both the formes alike: for reiteration and doing of them often over againe, maketh them ſo plentifull, and abundant, that they are alwayes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6229:68"/> equallie preſent in eyther fort, as neede requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: by reaſon whereof there is ſome analogie and concordance betwixt theſe two formes. And thirdlie, as touching thoſe Letters which it cannot obtaine, (beeing ſo preciſelie kept by the right owner) it hath both as great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and is as well ſerved without them, becauſe it hath ſpeedier Letters for them, than if it had them, becauſe they are ſo ſlow.</p>

                  <p>Common or facile Writ, hath not onelie all the remnant unchoſen Letters of the Alphabet properlie belonging unto it, but both borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth oftentimes, the firſt choyſe of all Capitals, from the firſt ſort of Set hand, and arrogateth the ſecond choyſe of Minum Letters from the ſecond; and that by right of place, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie by option of chooſing: whereupon ariſeth a controverſie betwixt the ſaide ſecond forme of Set hand, and this preſent forme, which anone it behooveth mee to diſcuſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the deciſion thereof it ſubmitted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto me, (in ſtead of a more competent Iudge) and I haue both accepted the ſame, in and upon mee, and under-taken to pronounce definitiue ſentence therein, with all poſſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: but firſt, (as it becommeth all Earthlie Iudges) I will heare both the Parties.</p>
                  <p>The principall ſort, challengeth and taketh the ſecond choyſe of Minum letters unto it ſelfe; becauſe it hath ever bene in uſe of them by indoubted right, acclaimed by ſtation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, and option of ſecond chooſing.</p>
                  <p>And the common ſort, alledgeth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thoſe letters would ſeeme to pertaine unto the other ſort, by the ſame pretended and diſſembled right of place and chooſing; yet
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6229:70"/> they ought not, becauſe this ſorte hath beene cloathed with poſſeſſion thereof theſe manie yeares, paſt memorie of man: and therefore cannot of equitie bee fruſtrated now of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient right, except there had beene renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſpoſition made thereof, and anie of theſe Titles produced for inſtructing.</p>
                  <p>Nowe for remooving of theſe Queſtions, and Debates, I repell and refute the laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeance, becauſe the proponer thereof is not able to prooue the Antiquitie of poſſeſſion mentioned therein: and although it might bee prooved, it were no juſt cauſe to take away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable Right: and therefore I deſcearne, that theſe debatable Letters belong to the principall ſort; becauſe it hath undoubted Right thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by vertue of ſecond place, and ſecond choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: but becauſe the <hi>Common ſort</hi> becommeth indigent, or deſtitute of Minum letters, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Decreet, which I could not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew, but behoved to pronounce, according to Iuſtice, I will not utterlie diſcourage nor dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it, but haue a charitable reſpect thereunto, and the rather, becauſe it is more prompt and needfull in common buſineſſe, than the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſorte it ſelfe, (as all common meanes bee, rather than ſpeciall meanes.) <hi>Therefore,</hi> wite ye mee to haue aſſigned, and diſponed, &amp; by theſe preſentes aſſigne and diſpone the like ſorte of Minum letters, to the ſayde deſolate forme, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6229:71"/> that by doubling of ſuch Letters in the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, as haue no conſtant difference from thoſe which were latelie queſtionable. Likewiſe, with expreſſe adviſe, and conſent of eyther ſorte, I ordaine, that they ſhall bee both ſerved alike, with all that ſorte of Minum letters, as well debated, as added; and that there ſhall bee mutuall and reciprocall proportion of borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing and lending, affinitie, peace, and amitie, betwixt theſe formes continuallie heereafter, ſo long as there ſhall bee anie extract of this Booke extant, wherein this their ſubmiſſion and ordinance of peace is thus regiſtrated.</p>
                  <p>And on the other ſide I ordaine, that theſe ſortes of Minum letters giue equall obedience to both the ſortes of Writ, and ſerue them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differentlie, and that by reiterating of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo often as need ſhall require, or occaſion offer, though it were in one Page, yea, in one line, ſince they themſelues were doubled, or the number of them added for that effect: and none other ſorte added with them, nor put for them.</p>
                  <p>Which Common Writ is alſo written two manner of wayes, neither different in ſubſtance, quantitie, nor qualitie, but onelie in ſpeedineſſe. Firſt, it keepeth an indifferent mids: that is, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too ſpeedie, nor to ſlow: which is the beſt way, in reſpect of the legeableneſſe of it ſelfe, beeing written: but worſt, in regarde of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readineſſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6229:71"/> and ſlowneſſe to write.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, it is currentlie written, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſomewhat worſe, in reſpect of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comlineſſe, and raggedneſſe, when it is done: ſeeing it is but compoſed of all the abjectes, or derivatiue letters, of the Alphabet, which bee farre deſcended, and derived, from their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall proportion: (which originall is the whole Letters of the ſecond ſorte of Set hand) but yet it is ſo much the better, by how much it is more eaſie in doing: and therefore it is choſen, and ſingled out, as a forme moſt needfull in haſtie buſineſſes.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it may bee thought, that ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie of the Current letters belonging hereunto, be too ſlowlie, or wel writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ſo Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent-like as neede or haſte doeth require, I doe ſo of ſet purpoſe, becauſe no Man needeth to be directed by Preceptes, nor ſhewed by Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to write or forme letters evill, (that is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wrong manner) but rather both aye to be directed and ſhewed how to write well: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the moſt part bee deſirous both to learne themſelues, and to bee expeded in their effaires by others, with the eaſieſt and ſpeedieſt ſorte of Writ. And therefore, though I preſent in the Alphabet the Patterne of Current letters, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer the right ſhape, than they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie uſe to bee found in Current writ; yet eyther the inclination of the doer, expedition of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6229:72"/> the adoes, or both, will pervert and corrupt them ſo, that they will bee both ſoone enough, and farre enough, yea, too farre different there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from uncommanded: becauſe all commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes bee rather contrarie than agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mans diſpoſition: as it is farre more difficile to rowle a Channon Bullet up to the toppe of a Mountaine, than from thence unto the foote thereof.</p>
                  <p>Laſt, Common writ is found likewiſe to be of two ſortes: the one called Open Minum, and the other Cloſe: both written either indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, (that is, neyther too ſpeedie, nor too ſlow) or Current, at the will and option of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but the laſt thereof is beſt Current, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more ſpeedie in urgent effaires than the firſt. And though it bee impoſſible to make the ſpeedier ſortes eyther ſo legeable or comelie as the reſt, yet each one of them ought to bee reſpected for its peculiar propertie, to wit, celeritie; becauſe neyther time nor place will ſerue aye to write alike well, nor yet would it bee neceſſarie, though continuall occaſion might bee had of both theſe circumſtances.</p>

                  <p>THe Letters of this Character are divided two manner of wayes, ſome thereof bee Capitals, and ſome not: the Capitall letters bee of two ſortes, the one called Beginning Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, becauſe they are commonlie uſed at the beginning of Bookes and Evidences, whereof in this Alphabet there is but one; to wit, the firſt Capitall <hi>A,</hi> placed heere not for it ſelfe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie, but in name and behalfe of all beginning Capitals of the whole remnant Letters of the Alphabet: as alſo in place of whatſoever plaine or curious ſort of beginning Capitals can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie belong unto this Character.</p>
                  <p>And although I haue ſpent (yea, rather miſpent) much precious time, not onelie upon olde Capitall letters, both curiouſlie made, and filled up, with Portraites, and all ſortes of ſmall Draughtes; but upon painting and inventing of new Capitall Letters, diverſe formes of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Writ and Comparthementes: likewiſe, in writing of Teſtificates, with Golde, Silver, diverſe coloures of Inke, and ſortes of Writ; and both of Great Evidences and Small, belonging unto Clerkeſhip and Notarie, with one fayre and legeable Hand: as alſo in writing often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6229:73"/> both of Compts of great Revenewes, and of extraordinarie ſmall and compact writ, (to the great prejudice now of my ſight, as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the LORDES PRAYER at length in leſſe boundes than the ſcale of an Hairing) and manie other ſuch needeleſſe curioſities: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, (to my ſimple judgement) plaine Capitals ſwiftlie done, and ordinarie, or eaſie writing, and drawing; bee as much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, as they are more readie than all theſe: even as ſutes of gorgeous apparell, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered, paſſemented, and decored, be often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo much uncomelier, than fine plaine cloathing, as they are coſtlier. But indeede ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in rare employments at ordinarie times, or in ordinarie employments at extraordinarie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, any that haue inclination, and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent gifts to exerciſe themſelues therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſhall haue my conſent; yet not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but conditionallie, that they protract not ſo much time as I haue done in ſo doing, though they haue never ſo much alloted unto them for that effect; for I know (by dolefull experience, I meane, by neglecting of better exerciſes and other learning) that thoſe conceates are oftentimes more deceiueable, than profitable: and doubtleſſe the travels thereof would bee infinite, were not the doers are finite; and for a finite perſon, to enterpryſe anie infinite la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>except the prayſing of GOD,</hi> and turmoyle
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6229:73"/> himſelfe therewith exceſſiuelie, and tediouſlie, and then for little uſe, is (as teſtifieth the moſt wiſe, mightie, and experimented King that ever was, except our gracious Saviour) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, <hi>but vanitie, and vexation of ſpirite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other ſort of Capitall letters, are called middle Capitals, becauſe they are frequentlie written within lines of writ alreadie begun, and that at the beginning of ſentences and proper names; which be ofter different from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort, in quantitie and ſituation, than in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and proportion: whereof in this Alphabet there be 3. to wit, the remnant Capitall ſorts of <hi>A;</hi> which bee not placed heere for themſelues onely, but both as ſo manie Attourneyes for the whole middle Capitals of all the remnant letters of the Alphabet; and for all plaine and curious ſorts of middle Capitals, (of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever proportion) which can anywiſe pertaine unto this Character.</p>
                  <p>Theſe which bee not Capitals, are called Single and Double letters, (which ſtand in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der immediatelie after the Capitals throughout all the Alphabet to the ende) being 143. who liſt to number them.</p>
                  <p>Of the which there bee 121. Single letters, eaſie to bee knowne: and 22. Double, to wit, The 4. <hi>c</hi> in the Alphabet; (for hencefoorth I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>As for the dividing of letters in vowels and conſonants, and the ſubdividing thereof, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not therein; becauſe theſe diviſions doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long more to the nature of letters, than to their proportion: and therefore they are plainely enough divided in the Latine Grammar. Only heere, for knowing of them by their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will diſtinguiſh the vowell ſorts of <hi>i,</hi> and <hi>u,</hi> from the conſonant ſortes thereof, in this manner; to wit, the 1, 2, and 5 ſortes of <hi>i,</hi> be vowels: the 3 ſort of <hi>j,</hi> is a conſonant: the 4 ſort of <hi>ii,</hi> is a double vowel, or two conjuct vowels: and the 5 <hi>ji,</hi> is both a conſonant and a vowel, conjoyned in one. Likewiſe the 1, 2, 3, and 5 ſingle ſorts of <hi>u,</hi> be vowels: &amp; the firſt <hi>uu,</hi> is 2 vowels conjoyned: and the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 ſortes of <hi>v,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonantes; whereof 5 be ſingle, and 6 double.</p>

But if thou preferre, or giue Practiſe the firſt place, that is, ſuffer it to goe before Knowledge, it will be ſo much labour in vaine: (I meane chiefelie in peruſing of this Booke) ſeeing no right Practiſe can bee, without good Knowledge; no good Knowledge, without right Inſtruction; no right Inſtruction, but eyther from Aboue, or of ſuch as GOD hath gifted to informe and inſtruct Belowe: for it is hard for anie Man to teach another rightlie to doe anie rare worke, which hee himſelfe cannot perfectlie doe firſt; or to tell the right Tokens of an obſcure Way, wherein hee never walked: and ſo right Inſtruction, maketh good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; good Knowledge maketh right Practiſe; and good Knowledge, and right Practiſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, including Reaſon, goeth neareſt to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of anie thing: and the laſt of theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee rightlie done without the helpe of the firſt, no more than the Hand can rightlie proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quute anie other Action, without the ayde of the Minde: for as the Minde firſt imagineth anie thing before the Hand execute the ſame;

            <p n="1">I. When eyther thou entereſt to learne, or having ſomewhat learned before, let the whole Single and Double Letters bee caſten with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſquare, both in Alphabet, by the ſpace of three dayes, and in lines of writ two dayes: which muſt needes bee juſtlie drawne after this Patterne, of the like diſtance, or eyther farther or nearer, as ſhall bee requiſite for the quantitie of their proportion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Two dayes to want the halfe of the high ſquare, after this manner, but endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to doe as if thou hadſt it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Two dayes to want al the high ſquare, except a little entreſſe thereof at the beginning; and that for imprinting in thy memorie which of two thou wanteſt, as thus.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:6229:87"/> IV. Three dayes to want the high ſcore altogether, and to write on the low ſcore: but ſtill be mindfull that it is the high ſquare which is abſent; becauſe manie oftentimes miſtake ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſquare, and that ſometimes by making the bodies of letters, halfe aboue, halfe under the ſame, it beeing in the middeſt; and ſometimes under the lowe ſquare, and ſo nothing aboue, ſaue heads of letters, as if it were the high ſquare indeede, and not that which it is.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Other three dayes with halfe ſingle ſquare.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Three dayes yet with a piece ſingle ſquare, both to ſhow where lines ſhould begin, and how farre diſtant to make them.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Without ſquares altogether, the ſpace of ſixe dayes.</p>

               <p>I know, ſome of thoſe who can write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alreadie, will thinke it an indignitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin againe at the caſting of letters, (I meane ſeverallie by order of Alphabet) even as if the action or practiſe of all writ which ever they haue written, or will write, conſiſted not in the caſting and framing of letters: it is never ſhame to doe well, (that is, anie thing that may tende to a good uſe) and (as I ſaid once before) farre better late nor never: for many that can even caſt Letters well, cannot caſt them the right way, and each one that can caſt them the right way, cannot caſt them after a comely manner, I meane to beginne, follow foorth, and accompliſh each one, both formallie and decentlie, from the firſt part thereof to the midſt, and from the midſt to the laſt: and if ſo be, farre leſſe are they able to obſerue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the remnant injunctions, whereof this Arte requireth obſervance and performance.</p>

               <p> And to ſhun and reject the burthen of the which, it may bee that ſome of them alledge there be moe things preſcribed than need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but (to my judgement) there is not an ydle Precept in all this Booke: indeede, becauſe they cannot be all of a like weight, the greateſt ſort hath the greateſt neceſſitie in the obſervation: for when anie Arte is either taught or written, it ought to bee taught and written largelie, and no neceſſarie thing purpoſelie omitted; becauſe, in the learning and practiſing thereof, there wil bee enough, yea too much neglected, that ought to be reſpected. And ſo, when all is done that can be done, there reſteth enough to doe, though at the firſt, there bee no wilfull negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: let inſtructors therefore ſtriue to know and practiſe all which be anie wayes needefull and expedient, and Studentes followe onely ſo maniethings as be moſt needefull, and moſt expedient.</p>
               <p>And albeit manie letters, yea even of one ſort, bee oftentimes caſten after divers wayes, which doeth proceede of the diſconformitie of inſtructing, which hath bene in times paſt; yet all men (with unitie of minde) will confeſſe that there is no way ſo good as the righteſt way: and the way heere taught and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I proue to be the righteſt: (let others try or eſſey as they pleaſe) becauſe letters being made conforme to it, not onlie getteth the

            <p>IF thou be one that wouldeſt ſoone learne, it is for thy cauſe that this Alphabet of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Letters following, being 48 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as they bee diverſe in ſortes, are choſen and extracted foorth of the great Alphabet, and caſten by degrees in this manner following: and that both for thy better conſideration of them all in generall, and imitation of each one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And if thou be any wayes tractable and carefull to learn, thou mayſt hereby vnderſtand them aſwell, and follow them better, than if thou haddeſt ſeene them written by any ſkilfull Maſter Writer after the ordinarie forme: (that is, without more inſtruction, than they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie uſe to giue) and whereas thou mayeſt perhaps alledge, he would both doe &amp; ſpeake, that is, both write, and tell how to write; write Exemplars, and declare how to to follow them: my anſwere is, thy alledgeance may well hold againſt a bare Exemplar Booke, but not againſt this; for ſuch a booke may well ſhew thee the ende afarre off, but it concealeth the way that leadeth thereunto; and ſo will ſuffer thee to fall
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6229:92"/> into an hundereth ditches, if thou ſhouldeſt walke therein without a guide: it ſheweth thee a little indeede, what to follow, but neither the meanes whereby, nor the manner how to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and ſo is a moſt obſcure teacher everie way: yea, and ſo ſenſeles that it cannot doe ſo much, as ſigne its owne meaning: why then, is it any marvell that theſe bookes be for the moſt part to all learners un-imitable, and few the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof that buy them? It is not the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a fayre complete Palace, that can teach a young Maſon (newlie paſſed Apprentize) to builde, or bee Maſter of Worke to the like; but hee muſt needes either bee preſent at the founding of ſuch a one, and ſtill continue till it bee accompliſhed, or elſe haue the knowledge of ſome ſecrete preceptes of that Arte or Craft, either left unto him by ſome neare friende, who hath bene a cunning Maſter Builder (he then beeing ingenious and carefull to practiſe them) that muſt firſt teach him. But this Booke, as it pleaſeth GOD doeth all theſe things, which it cannot doe; it not only ſheweth the ende, the meanes, and the way how to winne thereunto; but how to ſhunne all dangers in the way, and come ſafelie to the ende.

And when all is done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they learne by Worde or Writ, by theſe bookes, or this booke, as I ſaid of before in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, that as Practiſe availes litle without knowledge; even ſo knowledge availeth as litle without practiſe.</p>
            <p>Further, if thou wouldeſt know the viue proportion, quantitie, and ſituation of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, heads, and tailes of letters, either beholde, or ſingle them out as they ſtand in the great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet; and how each one is compared or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Comparations or Deſcriptions thereof preceeding this place: and if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt know howe manie ſtroakes may ſerue to caſt each one before the pen bee lifted, either beholde them, or elſe abſtract them foorth of the Narration following hereafter: by which meanes thou mayeſt haue ſufficient information and inſtruction thereanent; and that by thine owne diligence: for I thinke thou art not ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but thou knoweſt unto whom thou workeſt, and whoſe errand thou goeſt.</p>

            <p>And ſince there be diverſe exceptions from this Rule, I divide them into foure rankes, both for the cauſes of better conſideration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof: 1, there bee ſome letters which muſt needes haue the pen taken up both to, and after, the caſting of each one of them; 2, ſome onlie to the caſting; 3, ſome after the caſting (as for the up-taking in the caſting of letters, I omit it, becauſe it muſt needes bee doue; and therefore ought not to be reſtrained) and 4, there be ſome which haue no conſtant or faſt ſtrokes going from them to others, but a movable or variable of-ſet, ariſing from a clozed

               <p>A Sillable, may admitte anie one or moe of the Single and inſeparable Double Leters, or any one of the 5 ſeparable double which follow to be ſpoken off, to wit, the 5, 6 8, 9, <hi>e,</hi> being Diphthongs, and the 5 <hi>n,</hi> as the nature thereof requireth; &amp; ſometimes though two letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a ſillable, one is expreſſed onlie, another underſtoode, and a little rowme left voyde for the ſame, with a crooked daſh made like a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> ſet over it; which is uſed in Poeſies for the Verſe cauſe, as in the laſt Sillables of theſe words,</p>
               <p>And ſo, if thou canſt ſpell, or ſyllabe well, and place the Letters rightlie, which follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that is, as they are directed to bee; thou needſt neither to make up Sillables of wrong Letters, by nature or ſound; nor place Letters wrong in Sillables, by a diſagreeable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <head>THE CONCLVSION, Somevvhat concerning Puncts, and Accentes; as alſo Abreviations, <hi>and of the Effayres, and Writs, wherein they are most uſed.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow in ende, it reſteth only that I ſpeake of Puncts, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, and Abreviations, uſed in Writ: albeit the writing of Puncts and Accents, doeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto this Arte, yet the nature and uſe of them pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Hebrew, Latine, and Greeke Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars, and other Authors; where they be largely taught: wherefore I thinke it neither needefull to declare how to write them, becauſe they are ſo plaine and eaſie, nor yet to enter in diſcourſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6229:121"/> thereanent; but remit thee unto theſe places, where if thou bee learned, thou art alreadie, if not, thou mayeſt bee ſufficientlie informed of their definitions and obſervations; and if thou bee not learned, thou haſt little uſe for Puncts, and no uſe for Accents.</p>
            <p>An Abreviation, is the contracting or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of ſome Sillables or Letters; and that either by one or moe Letters themſelues, or ſome other ſignificatiue ſtroake or ſigne made with the pen, knowne ſometimes by Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes by Situation, and ſometime by both.</p>
            <p>When thou writeſt or extracteſt haſtily any matter of little weight, it is the right and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time, to write the moſte uſuall Abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations either of Wordes, Sillables, or Letters, as occurreth in the matter, and uſeth or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to bee abreviated or written ſhort: for manie things muſt be written even concerning weightie matters, ſuch as Engroſments, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Compts, Scroles, Minutes, and others of that nature, which neede ſeldome to bee written long, (that is, with all the Letters at length) or yet in the beſt ſorts of writ. And while as they be ſometimes otherwiſe found, it proceedeth rather of the will and diſpoſition of the diligent Writer, by whom they are written, the Perſon to whome, or both, than being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:6229:122"/> requiſite of their owne nature; ſeeing they are neither heretable rights for long endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, perfect Patternes of learned Mens works for the Printing, nor Teſtificats to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but, if it bee thy will to prolong time in ſo doing, and declare thy cunning in writing of employments better than they uſe to be, rather than in anie worſe exerciſe; I for my part ſhall both thinke thy travell well beſtowed, and condeſcend thereunto with litle ſolicitation.</p>
            <p>Abreviations, or contractions therefore, being moſt frequent in ſuch and the like buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, requireth to be written in Current Writ; becauſe there is little diſparitie betwixt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe two: for as Current Writ is not choſen in ſuch effaires, for anie goodneſſe in it ſelfe, being the off-ſcourings and worſt of all writ, but onlie for the ſwiftneſſe; even ſo Abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations are not uſed for anie goodneſſe in themſelues, ſeeing they but figure Letters, and Letters painte the Voyce, or demonſtrate the minde; and ſo being a degree farther in place, are a degree worſe in nature: which therefore, muſt rather be conſidered Hierogly phicallie, &amp; Myſticallie, by ſignification of Senſe, than Silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bically, by ſound, or ſillabication of Sillable; and that becauſe the Letters themſelues are not all expreſſed, nor preſent, whereby to make an harmonie; but a great part thereof contracted,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:6229:122"/> and abſent; and ſo therefore are but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode to bee, or imagined as if they were. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ſome of the moſt legeable Abreviations may agree to the two ſorts of Common hand, aſwell as the two ſorts of Current hand, but ſeldome, or never, to the two ſorts of Set hand.</p>
            <p>Which Abreviations, I thinke not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to collect, and inſert heere, nor yet to bee curious in deſcribing of them; but rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them unto thine owne experiment, and to the daylie practique of the Countrey, as they occurre to thee in the Wordes and Sentences of the Writs and Securities wherein they are moſt uſed; and that for two reſpectes:</p>
            <p>Firſt, albeit the writing of them belongeth to Chirographie, yet their ſignification is not pertinent to bee heere; ſeeing the ſame pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Ortographie: and is to bee found (at the leaſt, underſtoode by certaine ſignes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed) in frequenting of the former Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Writs; that is, by often reading, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, or conſidering, of the ſame; eyther of purpoſe to learne them, or for the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thy neceſſarie negotiations, and that in the companie of anie cunning Clerke or Notare, (with whome thou mayeſt haue ſuch farther knowledge and exerciſe, as may eyther bring thee to ſome good Calling, or helpe thee to manage thine Eſtate, if thou bee borne to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:6229:123"/> Rentes) and though I ſhould beſtow travell on the collecting, and charges of the making of Types for Printing, exponing, and preſenting of them unto thy ſight in a Tatalogue; yet all would bee unprofitable, and needleſſe, for want of their ſignifications, unto the which the boundes of this Diſcourſe doeth not reach.</p>
            <p>Next, becauſe all the preceeding Rules of this Booke are ſo infallible, that (to my ſimple judgement) they neede not in ſubſtance to bee altered: and ſo it would bee more ridiculous, than judicious, to adde anie thereunto which bee changeable nowe in the ende of this laſt intch, more than in the whole ſpanne.</p>
            <p>Theſe Abreviations (I ſay) are Changeable for two Cauſes: firſt, becauſe for the moſte parte everie ſorte of Abreviation is found com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie to haue two or three ſignifications al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as often as one; and ſo are rather under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode by the Sentence wherein they are, than by the forme or manner of their contracting: in reſpect whereof, fewe or none of them can eyther bee commaunded, or contramaunded by Rules, to keepe anie ſingle ſignification, yea, ſcarcelie a double.</p>
            <p>And laſt, becauſe ſome of them are made freelie, and ſome conſtraynedlie, theſe that are ſayde to bee made freelie, or reſolutelie, are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarilie made at the particular will of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:6229:123"/> Writer: for everie Mechanicke Man eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth much of his owne conceite: and it is harde to comprize the true valour thereof, howſoever perhaps in his owne imagination it bee worth the halfe of his Rent.</p>
            <p>And theſe Abreviations, which are ſayde to bee made conſtraynedlie, or indeliberatelie, are abruptlie made, by occaſion of haſte, and conſequentlie of faſt Writing, yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for lacke of convenient time and place: becauſe Neceſſitie hath no Law, and ſo is not capable of Reproofe.</p>

               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:6229:126"/>
               <p> Indeede, there are ſome common Preceptes of this Arte both univerſall and oft written, by divers VVriters, which, ſo farre as I haue ſeene, &amp; found right, I re-ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and confirme heere, as few olde buildinges, bee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo ruinous, but either ſome Stones or Timber there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may ſerue to helpe the newe: and on the contrarie, ſuch Preceptes as bee otherwayes, or agree not with this Character, as it is now practiſed, I reject altogether; as more unfit for anie uſe, than the verie Redde or off-ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes of olde Buildinges: for the one cannot doe ſo much as helpe to defende the Arte whereof it would appeare to bee a parte, but the other, although it cannot bee ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the walles of newe worke, yet it may ſuffice to fill up a parte of the Rampart thereof, and ſo ayde the ſame with ſome kinde of Fence. So eyther theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes haue beene wrong from the beginning, or elſe the uſe of them is changed, thorow long continuance of time, (wherein everie thing changeth, except the Bleſſed Creator of all thinges) as the moſte exquiſite humane Invention of olde, is mightilie both metamorphoſed and augmented now, by ſome cunning Tranſlator: not that the Author thereof hath beene inferiour to him in Skill, (as wee muſt charitablie judge) for the Author thereof had no Patterne at all to followe: and therefore ſo long as his foundation ſtandeth, hee is worthie to haue place: at the leaſt his VVorke, if his Name bee ſuppreſt: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Tranſlator and augmenter catcheth ſometimes a three-folde advantage: first, by inspection of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion layde by the foundator: next, by inspection of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

               <p>But theſe precepts immediatelie before mentioned are ſo few, unneceſſarie, difficill, and confuſed, that few can bee able to practiſe them aright, without the belpe of an instructor; and although each one eaſilie might, they coulde attaine thereby to no perfection in Faire Writing, without much farther instruction: and ſo, the most complete, neceſſarie, plaine, methodicall, and conſequentlie the best Worke, out of all question will bee thought the rarest Worke, and at the highest rate; what Worke, or whoſe Worke ſo ever it be, only if GOD be the principall efficient, or true Author thereof.</p>

               <p>Indeede, I thinke it better, that each one learne to write in ſome reaſonable meaſure perfectlie, before hee beginne eyther Grammar, or Philoſophie, for helping him to effectate his purpoſe both the ſooner and better, than after the ſame, but never in the midſt, except at ſome vacand houres by this Booke, for the reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the fift ſecundarie cauſe of the <hi>Argument.</hi> Likewiſe, ſuch Maſters of Grammar Schooles, or their under Teachers, as doe profeſſe to teach this Booke at certaine dyets to their Schollers, may inſtruct any Childe of reaſonable age or knowledge, almoſt as ſoone by theſe meanes, to bee both a Scholler and a Writer, as when hee is put to a Vulgar Maſter, only to learne to Write: and therefore one tranſumpt heereof is not onlie requiſite to bee bounde in Volum with the Latine Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, for each one that learneth the ſame, that hee may learne to ſpell Engliſh by the one, aſ well as Latine by the other; but likewiſe with anie Engliſh Booke for Lectors, that thereby they may learne to reade both.

                  </gap>e to learne. And ſecondlie, becauſe it is the firſt <hi>Impreſſion,</hi> and therefore requireth to bee the more ample: for if it pleaſe GOD to ſpare mee till this Eſſay bee cenſured abroad, corrected, and reformed, I intende to haue the Rules thereof made ſhorter, and publiſhed in Verſe, (both for the better getting, and keeping thereof in memorie, and likewiſe the remnant in better Proſe, Language, and Method: for the which respect I haue now made choyſe rather to adventure it foorth ſomewhat blockiſh, (that is, with the Paringes thereon) than to preſume at mine owne hand to pare it too neare at the firſt: for that which appeareth to bee good to one, will perhaps ſeeme bad to another: and none will denie, but it is as eaſie to ſubſtract and diminiſh, as to multiplie and augment. Alwayes, though the bodie of the Worke bee ſomewhat great, yet the Abridgement, and chiefelie the tenne Precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are as ſhort as poſsiblie they might. And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ampleneſſe of thoſe places, concerning the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Penne from the Paper, they could not bee ſo well nor plaine otherwayes; becauſe, firſt I bring the moſt parte of Letters once under a Rule, and ſo manie as be excepted, do come in by way of exception, by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie rankes as the Penne requireth to bee lifted: for even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To the ſecond parte I anſwere, that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition at all, but where it muſt needes bee: and when anie is, it is rather by appearance, than in effect: for if one parte confirme another, it but linketh the whole Booke together, as it ought: and what one parte wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, another hath, without anie frivolous repetition. Doeth not the verie Sacred Scripture it ſelfe agree in paſſages and phraſes, each parte exponing another? and the Heavenlie matter thereof disperſed and ſprinkled thorow out all: for one parte hath the occaſions, or time of the occurrence, or doing of a thing; another the place; the third, the cauſes; the fourth, the effect: and ſo foorth. Thus each one beeing firſt conferred with another, and then joyned together, doe make up a whole and complete ſenſe: for though there bee manie Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes in a flouriſhing Citie, yet no man is anie more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned for himſelfe onelie, than hee can liue by himſelfe alone, without the helpe of others: and ſo each one ought to doe good to another, by borrowing and lending, (gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and forgiving) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>To the third parte I anſwere: That there is no Arte nor Hiſtorie, but in ſome partes thereof the contents and matter is more baske and barren, than in another, if thou wilt enter into particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration therof: yea, the very Booke of GOD it ſelfe would ſeeme at the first ſo to be, &amp; chiefelie ſome partes of the Holie Hiſtorie of our Bleſſed

And yet if it had pleaſed the Spirit of GOD, out of all doubt, hee could haue indited the ſame both in Methode and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as farre beyond all other Bookes, as it ſurpaſſeth them in Matter, Wiſdome, and Valour: and it is indeede ſo farre beyond them, that it hath ſurmounted the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of all the Philoſophers that ever was, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all their Wiſedome, Learning, and Rhetoricke) Againe, if thou wilt looke to the formes obſerved in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Artes, beholde but the Latine or Greeke Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and thou wilt oftentimes finde one place more haske, and unpleaſant than another; yea, it will ſeeme altogether fooliſh, ydle, and without ſenſe, to anie man that never learned ſuch things: and that becauſe, both the Matter and Language of Grammars, ſerue but for themſelues, and not for other purpoſes which occurre in common effaires, wherein hee is best verſed.</p>
               <p>And as for the Similitudes, they are verie needfull, not onelie for preſent underſtanding of the ſenſe in time of reading; but in like manner thereafter, the memorie of the Similitude, will oftentimes demonstrate a newe conſideration of the whole matter repreſented thereby, to mens rememberance againe, who perhaps without the ſame would eyther not haue conceived it at all, or ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to ſlippe as ſoone out of their mindes, as it entered

               <p>I confeſſe, not long after it was begun, I accepted ſuch adviſe as made for mee, and rejected the reſt, as all Writers doe when they intend to ſet foorth Workes; for <hi>Salomon</hi> willeth that everie man (how wiſe ſoever he be) take counſell when hee interpryſeth anie matter of importance: becauſe oftentimes one will both know and ſee a thing, that another will neither underſtand nor perceiue, yea, though he haue both as good judgement, &amp; as ſharpe ſight: but indeede never man read it over thereafter, till it was all Printed except the fore and latter partes, as is over probable by it ſelfe.</p>

               <p>And as concerning the other parte of the Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I honour them for their giftes of Learning, and ſo farre as I am able, I prayſe GOD for mine owne: I will compare with no man, but yeelde unto all men, (except in ſo farre as I will ſtudie to defende the ſober giftes which I haue, for His cauſe unto whome they juſtlie belong, that they never bee dung downe with boaſt of toome wordes, but rather with actions, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon right Knowledge and Reaſon: for in ſo doing.
